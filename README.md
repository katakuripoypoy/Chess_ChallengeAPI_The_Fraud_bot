# Chess_ChallengeAPI_The_Fraud_bot
the API used in this is the Chess_Challenge the coding language is C# if you want to start with a pre-built bot and improve it I have increased the token limit of the original challenge 

if you want to increase the token limit or lower it you can go to:
Chess_Challenge_main => Chess_Challenge => src => FrameWork => Aplication => core => Settings
